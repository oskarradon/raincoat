# Bourbon Neat Jade SCSS Boilerplate
This is a boilerplate for web projects using the Bourbon Neat grid framework, with SCSS, Jade, and a nice Gulp task to bring everything together.

## Explaination
The project is split into `src` and `dist` directories, `src` for the unminified Js, jade, and SCSS, and `dist` for the minified, autoprefixed versions of your code, the HTML, and the `assets` folder for images, PDFs, etc.

## Set-up Instructions
1. Make sure you have node and gulp globally installed
2. Install node packages: `npm install`
3. Run the gulp task: `gulp` which spins up local dev server
4. Go for it! Your changes to the `src/` folder should be compressed/compiled into the `dist/` folder and visible instantly thanks to browsersync :)
